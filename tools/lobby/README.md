# The lobby (room codes)

A Cloudflare Worker that turns a room code into the other player's address. No game traffic goes through it: the
two games connect to each other directly, and only when they can't (a phone's 5G, some office or university
networks) through Cloudflare's TURN relay. One lobby serves VF1, VF2 and VF3.

Cost on the Workers Paid plan ($5 a month): the Worker and its Durable Objects are well inside what the plan
includes. The TURN relay is only used by matches that can't connect directly; a match through it uses under
100 MB an hour, and Cloudflare's first 1,000 GB a month are free ($0.05 a GB after).

## Setting it up (once)

Everything runs on the Mac, from this folder.

1. Put the Worker online. `wrangler login` opens the browser: allow it.

   ```
   cd ~/vf3-recomp/tools/lobby && npm install && npx wrangler login && npx wrangler deploy
   ```

   The last lines it prints give the lobby's address, like `https://vf-lobby.yourname.workers.dev`. Keep it.

2. Make a TURN key: in the Cloudflare dashboard, **Realtime** (in the left column; it may be under
   **Calls**) > **TURN Server** > **Create**, name it `vf-lobby`. It shows a **Turn Token ID** and an
   **API Token** (the token only once: copy it now).

3. Give them to the Worker (each command asks for the value: paste it, Enter):

   ```
   cd ~/vf3-recomp/tools/lobby && npx wrangler secret put TURN_KEY_ID && npx wrangler secret put TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN
   ```

4. Check it (with your address from step 1):

   ```
   curl https://vf-lobby.yourname.workers.dev/v1/ping
   curl -X POST https://vf-lobby.yourname.workers.dev/v1/turn -d '{}'
   ```

   The first says `{"ok":true,...}`, the second lists `servers` with a username and credential. `no_turn`
   means step 2 or 3 went wrong: put the secrets again.

5. Build the games with the address: `export VF_LOBBY_URL=https://vf-lobby.yourname.workers.dev` before
   the build commands (or set it as the default in the Makefile). A build without it shows only the
   by-address matches.

## Changing it later

`npx wrangler deploy` again after editing `src/index.js`. Rooms open at the time are dropped, nothing else.
`npx wrangler tail` shows the requests as they come in.

## Testing on one's own computer

`npx wrangler dev --port 8787`, with a TURN server of your own (coturn) named in `.dev.vars`:

```
TURN_STATIC=[{"host":"127.0.0.1","port":3478,"username":"test","credential":"secret"}]
```

and the games started with `VF_LOBBY=http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

## What it keeps

A room: the host's name, game, version and addresses, for as long as the host's game keeps asking (it's gone 30
seconds after the host stops, two hours at most). Requests are limited per IP address (kept in memory only). No
logs are written by the Worker.
